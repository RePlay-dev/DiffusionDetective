# DiffusionDetective

DiffusionDetective is a project developed as part of a bachelor thesis titled "Detection of Diffusion-Generated Images Extended With Explainable AI Techniques." The project implements and compares multiple approaches for detecting diffusion-generated images. The main image classifier is built using FastAI and is based on the ConvNeXt v2 architecture. Additional detection models incorporated in this project include, 'ClipBased-SyntheticImageDetection', and 'DMimageDetection'. To provide insights into the decision-making process of the classifier, the project integrates several Explainable AI (XAI) techniques: RISE (Random Input Sampling for Explanation), AblationCAM, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). This repository contains the implementation of these models and explainers, along with documentation and experimental results. The project aims to contribute to the ongoing research in AI-generated image detection and explainable AI in the context of image classification.
